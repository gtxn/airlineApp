# airlineApp
this system has an admin application and a visitor website and is meant for airline passengers to order their food through the system. This was inspired by the COVID-19 situation where air stewards had to go aisle by aisle taking the food orders of passengers. This system is a solution to that problem by allowing visitors to key in their orders locally
