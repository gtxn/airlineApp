# airlineApp
This system has an admin application and a visitor website and is meant for airline passengers to order their food through the system. This was inspired by the COVID-19 situation where air stewards had to go aisle by aisle taking the food orders of passengers, and is a solution to that problem by allowing visitors to key in their orders locally. But do cut me some slack because this was coded rather quickly and I didn't know how an airplane system worked, and I'm assuming they can't connect to cloud services, so the database is just a text file in the server.
